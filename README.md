# **The Programming Portfolio of Chelsea Rumsey**


For this project, I have built a website containing each programming project that I have completed so far on my coding journey.


To run this project on your local computer, you will need to complete the following tasks:

1. Create a virtual Python environment in your IDE of choice by running the following command in your terminal: 
    
    If you are using a Windows PC use: 
        `python -m venv env`

    If you are using a Mac that was manufactured before 2020, you likely have Python aliased as python3. Use the following command:
        `python3 -m venv env`


2. Activate your virtual Python environment by running the following command in your terminal:

    If using Windows:
        `.\env\Scripts\activate`

    If using Mac/Linux use:
        `source ./env/bin/activate`

    
>NOTE: If you shut down the terminal or reboot your computer, the virtual environment will become deactivated. To reactivate the virtual environment you will need to run the activation command again.


3. Install the required dependencies into your Python environment:

    Install the project requirements from the provided requirements.txt file by running the following command in your terminal:
        `pip install -r requirements.txt` 


### What I learned by completing this project:
    This project has taught me how to create a fully integrated website using html, CSS, SQLAlchemy, and Python, all within the Flask framework.
