            'description':f'''For this project, I created a random number 
                            guessing game in which the player is asked to: 
                            "Pick a number between 1 and 10". The player's 
                            job is to make a guess, and the program will tell 
                            them whether their guess is too high or too low. 
                            Their next guess is based on what the program has 
                            told them. The game ends when the player guesses 
                            the correct number. Usually, players will try to 
                            do this in the lowest number of tries possible.''',

                                the players into equal teams for the upcoming basketball season.

                                I applied my knowledge of built-in Python data types and combined 
                                these types to create structures to store and organize a team of 
                                basketball players into distributed teams. This tool not only balances 
                                the teams by the total number of players but also lets you generate some
